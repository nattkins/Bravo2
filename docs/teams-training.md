## Some truths we take to be self-evident


* It is better to do good, badly than to do bad, goodly.
* Teams that don't know what they are good for - aren't likely to do any good.
* Teams, as imagined by Microsoft, or by the people at Zoom, were not designed to reflect any of your organizations' particular ways of working. If they do, that's an accident.
* People seem to learn best by doing, and won't be much good at anything the first time of trying.
* This opportunities this pandemmic offers must be taken to reassert some truths and to learn new skills, and ideally both together.
* There is nothing about teams that you could not, with enough time, learn  from the internet.

## Our purpose in this training

We begin with a challenge and a group of people and ends with people able to see themselves within a team with a purpose: able to communicate, collaborate and make the most of their skills.

## The Overview Course

### The Overview Course Preparation 
Before we begin -  Assemble the people into teams and nominate facilitators  / super users also ideally admins as well as separate people
The organization will establish the teams to work with - we at Bravo Criteria can help with this, but maybe this is something that you have already done. 
The Overview course 

### The Overview Course Session 0 
[return to course summary ](#course-summary)

Introductions and saying hello - this is a do you hear me, do you hear everyone else, can you connect, have you got an excellent place to call from, are you sitting in front of the window - The session ends when everyone is ready. Lastly, we schedule when the next session will be, and if there is any time, allow questions about the training going forward.

### The Overview Course Session 1
[return to course summary ](#course-summary)

To learn what THIS team is good for - and to see Microsoft Teams or Zoom working in real-time. 
We use teams 'break-out' rooms to enable parallel working and using the speed clean questions we discover "When the people in this team are working at their best, it's like what?"
* We will guide the members of the team in discovering and knowing their purpose and on the way seeing in action what teams has to offer them and their particular team:
There will be opportunities to use, for example:
* Channels
* Chat
* Document sharing
* As well as document collaboration 
* Planner  
* Whiteboard 
* Forms
* Wiki

And for each element that we introduce to the team:
* Figure out, from what you have seen, what you can use immediately 
* Decide what you need more information about -before you can make it your own.
* What seems like it's not going to work for this team.
And lastly, we introduce users to how they can learn everything else they need - using the app.

### The Overview Course Post session homework

The team must come up with a purpose statement - something that makes sense to someone not in the team, that ensures that they are doing the right things.

#### Purpose Statement
This is in three parts 
1. What this team does uniquely i.e. The PMO so only it supports the managment of projects .
1. Collaboratively - what it does collectively - this is who does it need to work with to accomplish this unique purpose - i.e. for a PMO team this would be all the project teams, the programme managers etc
1. Be just as good as everyone else - what does it need to do just as well as any other department to accomplish the above two roles - for the PMO  this might be create intranet pages, share documents, send email, engage in chat, run podcasts. 


## The Digging Deep Course 

### The Digging Deep Course Preparation

### The Digging Deep Course
[return to course summary ](#course-summary)

> Turn that purpose into actions 

For all those teams that need more information, we provide traditional tailored training, preparatory to this session the team will provide a list of questions and issues.

For teams with concern that some functionality that they need is missing , it is necessary to review their purpose statement. If the unique purpose of the team is hampered by this functionality being missing, then this could be a reason for further development or purchasing of further solutions. On the other hand, where their purpose and functionality have nothing in common, there is an opportunity to see what the limits of out of the box are. 

This session will be quite free wheeling and it may run to several sessions.

[return to course summary ](#course-summary)

A fast paced sharing session - that provides maximum inspiration.

How to do the cool stuff that makes being in a team exciting and reduces stress.
Identifying stress
Uses the tech for what's its best for, rather than getting it to be an inferior version of in-person interactions.

### Accessibility all areas session
[return to course summary ](#course-summary)

We're pretty serious about accessibility and so this session is a one on one session where users can explore the best way to get the most from the tech they have.
These session are not charged in the usual way - instead each session is broken into two parts the first is a short clean scoping session where we establish if there is a need to do further work, what is the best form for that work and lastly whether the user is ready to do the work. The purpose being to only work with those that have a use for it. 
The second session is very much aligned with what the first session establishes.
