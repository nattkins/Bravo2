title: Why We Work
excerpt: Our Mission and the technolgies we use
---

## Our Mission
We believe that you like us want to spend time with the people that matter and doing work that matters. Here at Bravo Criteria, we have found that that there are technologies that can enhance collaboration, promote creativity and make work more rewarding and purposeful.

### So that means working remotely, right?

Absolutely, but if you try to remote work just like you always did before when you have to work remotely, you've missed a great opportunity. In-person meetings don't translate well into remote working because there was so much going on that we just took for granted:
* Turn-taking and related mind reading tricks
* You can change the venue to suit during the meeting, outside on warm days, across the street over coffee, over lunch (stop It! I'm getting * weepy) 
* Bumping into people, how many essential meetings happened for you in corridor on the way somewhere else?
* Meetings while walking (one of my prefered ways to discuss ideas)
* Collaboratively working on a whiteboard - with working pens, I would kill for a really good remote solution that did all a good whiteboard could do.
* Impromptu meetings (in the pub)
* Talking to someone at their desk 
* Floor walking 
Using actual props to explain concepts, I am a big fan myself of sugar * sachets, coffee cups and spoons to explain concepts.

## But there is an opportunity too?

Definitely - remote means that you can pretty much do all those things AND some that you have never tried you only have to be more conscious about it. 

> Children need things explaining, and we're all children in this new remote world.

We are all grown-ups in the old world of physical presence, and like children, we must learn new ways to communicate, and this is where people, thinking and digital technologies come in:

### What are people technologies?
These are technologies for ensuring that we work well with others, this stuff isn't new, but it now has added urgency.:


#### Clean language 
It's a truism that listening is the most valuable and least valued skill that a person or an organization can have, clean language is listening turned up to 11 !. Its a series of breathtaking simple questions that when deployed in the right way, can reveal a person or organizations way of thinking, usually to the surprise of the person questioned. 

#### Liberating structures 
Gives you an evolving suite of tools, that are more like games, that enable parallel creativity, it's these that make possible productive bumping into, brain-storming and a host of other mind-expanding ways of working.


### Thinking Technologies

#### Stoicism
We take from a noble history, a simple lesson which is that before you react in either in anger or sorrow take a beat and consider is this your anger or sorrow. 

#### Hedonic Sustainability 
Stoicism teaches that if we can step out of a negative feeling for even a moment we can gain insight. Modern psychology teaches that well-being comes from stepping into positive emotions and experiences, celebration, gratitude and 'counting one's blessings' could be the most important things we can do for ourselves and those around us.

#### Agile project management 
Enables a group of people or team to work on a set of tasks that amount to a meaningful deliverable thing, such that each person has sufficient freedom to engage their particular skills without getting under each other's feet and without the need of overseeer.
