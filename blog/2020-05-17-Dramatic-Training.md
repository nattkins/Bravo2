We begin with an exciting and fun experience and a group of people. We will finish with people able to communicate, collaborate and use Office 365 technologies to solve real problems - hopefully without anyone thinking they have been training.

Houston we have a problem - but we have the solution to training!

With the Apollo 13 mission as a backdrop, users go through an exciting experience where they will learn the fundamentals of teams, planner and document collaboration. We have built the content around those things we know are the things that users most often ask about.

Our innovative approach to training 

Everyone has done the training thing where they had to follow along with the steps and wondered to themselves - why? Now each function that. 

* Channels to manage the different concurrent collaboration activities - for example like the engineers working on the Co2 filter 
* Chat - how else to communicate with the astronauts in real-time.

* Document sharing - it's going to be vital to share documents, specifications, and collaborate upon them in real-time
* Planner  - Task management is crucial in such a mission; users will get a chance to try out which work best.

* We will make use of Microsoft streams to host clips of the film to set the scene 
* Guest access so that manufacturers and the astronauts themselves can all communicate back to Nasa Houston.
